          The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis we first pulled 
          data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

          After assemling the dataset we used matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. Latitude current weather forecasts, including: Temperature, windspeed, humidity, and cloud-cover forcasts. For many people temperature is make-or-break in where they decide to vacation, and it's also closely tied to where the location is in relation to the equator. While putting together our initial city data, we also pull in some statistics on the cities choosen. This Temperatures graph will show you the city's temperature versus their latitude (0 being the equator) so that you can see exactly how thorough we are being in our search for your perfect vacation spot.
