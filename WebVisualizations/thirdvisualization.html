            The first thing we do when you work with us is randomly generate 4000 different coordinates around the world and connect them to the nearest city. 
            
            After removing duplicates, you end up with between 500-800 randomly selected posible vacation locations. We then pull that city's current weather forecasts, including: Temperature, windspeed, humidity, and cloud-cover forcasts. For many people temperature is make-or-break in where they decide to vacation, and it's also closely tied to where the location is in relation to the equator. While putting together our initial city data, we also pull in some statistics on the cities choosen. This Temperatures graph will show you the city's temperature versus their latitude (0 being the equator) so that you can see exactly how thorough we are being in our search for your perfect vacation spot.
